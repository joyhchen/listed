I'm a firm believer that most people's favorite songs were simply there for them at [the right place and right time](/2023/05/14/timeplace20230514/) in their lives. I'm no different. At this point, I think my list of all-time favorite Mandopop songs is almost set in stone.

## Don't Break my Heart

I like that it's an upbeat rock song. I first heard it in a [movie about Beijing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Palace_(2006_film)) while living in Beijing (and Dou Wei is from Beijing). All in all, it reminds me a lot of Beijing.

## 童年

I like singing this at karaoke as an adult because it reminds me of how simple things were when I was a kid, and it's like, there's no reason my life can't be that simple now. That was also back when we had blackboards. Now they're all dry erase.

## 爱人错过

They have the most interesting new music.

## 我是不是你最疼爱的人

I found the emotion in this song easy to understand. Xuan Xuan's cover will always be the best version to me.

## 夜空中最亮的心

You know that one Chinese song that sounds like Coldplay but isn't. I've replayed it a million times though.

## 也罢

I like how she sings with emotion so effortlessly, and it feels genuine, not overdone.

## 静止

All around extremely underrated.

## 思念是一种病

I first heard [Robynn & Kendy's cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3U2y2G316E) of this song on the third season of The Voice of China. When they transitioned to "Where is the Love" I thought it was one of the best auditions I'd ever seen on the show. I love the original too. It's a classic.

## 无常

[Fuzao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzao) is Faye Wong's best album.

## 千里之外

My dad would play [Still Fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_Fantasy) all the time in the car growing up. It remains my favorite Jay Chou album to this day.

## 春天里

I like all of Wang Feng's popular songs. They sound nice.

## 太阳

No, not [that one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vlVjfMl_Nk). Not [her other song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv95k0zqnaA), or [the other one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZXy0t2i21A).

## 无与伦比的美丽

## 大艺术家

It's a really good pop song.

## 日常

I like songs about living life. "[To Hebe](https://youtu.be/Y-l8vok_tUE)" is good in that regard too.

## 假装我们没爱过

I feel like this song was lost to time. I also like [that one Fahrenheit song with the MV set in the desert](https://youtu.be/6b1cikZ8AvU) (?). That one is more famous.

## 牡丹江

You know when you listen to a song about a place, and even though you've never been there, you can feel how deeply the person who wrote the song feels about that place.
