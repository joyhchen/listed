Something that seems to confuse people who are not my age about people my age is the extent to which we grew up on the internet. I sometimes forget too, so I thought I would reflect on my history with the internet. To set your frame of reference, I was born in 2000 and am 23 years old at the time of writing this post. 

The earliest I remember using a computer is ~7 years old. This was around the time I started learning math. My dad bought paper workbooks for me to practice addition and subtraction problems. Around the same time, I started playing a math game on my dad's clunky 17-inch laptop. Every time I wanted to play it, I had to take the CD out of its case and insert it in the laptop. If I try hard enough, I can probably find the CD somewhere in my parents' house.

Around 2007 or 2008, I started playing internet games. In particular, I was fond of [ourWorld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OurWorld), [AdventureQuest Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdventureQuest_Worlds), [Chobots](https://chobots.fandom.com/wiki/Chobots), [Wizard101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard101), [RuneScape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuneScape), [Pirates of the Caribbean Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_Online), [Roblox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roblox), and [MapleStory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapleStory) at various points throughout elementary school. When you apply for a job at Roblox, they ask if you've played the game before. I have a Roblox profile created in 2008, which I was proud of when I applied to work there in college. Roblox was my favorite of the games I played growing up, with PoTCO coming in second. I also tried to learn to code for the first time because I wanted to make a successful Roblox game. I took some Lua tutorials, but it never went anywhere. I guess I wasn't dedicated enough.

Around middle school, I started using message boards. I don't remember the names of them anymore, but I was mostly active on forums dedicated to the games I liked to play. At this point, I became active on a site similar to Tumblr. You could customize your site with HTML, CSS, and JS, so this was my first experience learning to code. I mostly copied and pasted code from W3Schools, hacking together something that worked. Unlike my last attempt to learn to code, I actually learned something. Why was I successful in learning to code this time? I think there are two main reasons, 1) I was older and 2) the visual element made it more interesting to me. If you ask me why frontend is interesting to me *now*, the reason is more like I think it's cool you can express UI as a function of something. It's not so much I get to show other people my work anymore. Most people can't see what I work on, just due to the nature of the product I work on.

In any case, I guess I've been coding for however many years it's been since then, but I don't think about how long that is. Code is a tool for accomplishing certain tasks. If you come across one of those tasks, you can learn. If you don't, it doesn't matter.

In middle school, my family would go out to eat every week with some of my parents' friends. They had a daughter a year older than me, so we would talk while our parents discussed whatever adults discuss. She was on other corners of the internet than me, and she'd discovered K-Pop. She played some music videos for me, including [Super Junior "Sorry Sorry"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6QA3m58DQw), [B.A.P "Warrior"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tLooPlf2Sw), and [EXO "Mama"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH6ZwnqZ7Wo). I thought the songs were interesting, but it wasn't until a few months later that I became interested in [Hallyu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Wave) through Korean dramas. The first drama I watched was *[Love in Her Bag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_in_Her_Bag)*. I found it while browsing [DramaFever](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-shutting-down-korean-streaming-service-dramafever-1152834/#:~:text=DramaFever%20has%20lost%20its%20heat,subscription%20business%2C%20which%20Warner%20Bros.). I woudn't say the drama was memorable. The only reason I'm able to keep finding it is by googling "korean drama shinhwa bag jtbc" since I remember the brand in the drama is called Shinhwa, and thats about all I remember. It was 2013, and I started watching Korean dramas here and there, like *[Good Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Doctor_(South_Korean_TV_series))* (eventually remade in the US) and *[The Suspicious Housekeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Suspicious_Housekeeper)* (a remake of a Japanese drama).

Then, at the end of 2013, a drama called *[The Heirs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heirs)* started airing. It was probably the first TV show ever I looked forward to watching. Korean dramas would release two episodes every week, and then you would have to wait 6 days for the next two episodes. In those 6 days, I would wait in anticipation of what would happen next. *Heirs* is one of the most successful Korean dramas of all time. When I talk with anyone who got into Korean culture around the same time, it's one of the first names to come up. It's also the drama I credit with introducing me to message boards for discussing all-things Hallyu. When you're invested in a TV show, waiting for the next episode is almost agonizing, so naturally I found sites on the internet to discuss with other fans.

The only site that I clicked with was Reddit. I thought others, like Soompi and Allkpop, were too distracting. Reddit had a better ranking system and quality user comments. The thing about Reddit is it's easy to get pulled into "adjacent" subreddits. For K-Drama enthusiasts, K-pop is a natural adjacent interest. I was also a fan of the [*Heirs* original soundtrack (OST)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omH47UeVMu8). When a drama does well, the OST sometimes charts on popular music charts, making OSTs a common discussion topic in K-pop forums. While browsing K-pop sites, I learned about music shows. [Weekly music programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_programs_of_South_Korea) are a way for artists to promote their new music on TV. Each show is like a mini concert. But, because people tend to only watch the performer they're interested in, these sites would post links to the individual performances on the shows so you didn't have to watch the entire thing. Around a year after my friend originallly introduced me to K-pop, I saw [TVXQ perform "Something"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwbDMkJq8_M) on *Music Core*, and the appeal of K-pop finally clicked for me.

At this point, I was a regular browser of [/r/kpop](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop). But, Reddit wasn't really conducive for casual chatting, so the subreddit set up an IRC channel. Some people wonder if people my age have used IRC. For me at least, the answer is yes :). Not too long after, I started browsing other subreddits, and they started setting up servers on Discord. I found Discord around 2015, which is apparently [the year they were founded](https://discord.com/company#:~:text=So%2C%20in%202015%2C%20Stan%20and,friends%2C%20going%20beyond%20casual%20talking.). It's cool to discover I've been using Discord since its inception, even cooler to see how far the product has come. I didn't find out until years later how popular Twitter is with K-pop fans. I started using Twitter in college for news consumption and stumbled upon K-pop fandoms there, although I'm glad I didn't have Twitter in high school. I would have been even more distracted from school than I already was.

Anyways, I lost interest in K-pop around 2017, my senior year of high school. It's interesting to reflect on how little I think about something I used to spend a significant amount of time thinking about. That time shaped the way I view communities and social interaction on the internet. How many people have I just been [someone on the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w4nZyGVBwM) to?
